# Web3 Ethereum Learning Path

## **Easy**

1. **Token Creator**

   - [x] Build and deploy your own ERC-20 token on a testnet.
   - [x] Features: Minting, burning, and transferring tokens.
   - [x] Tools: Solidity, Hardhat, MetaMask.

2. **Basic Token Wallet**

   - [x] Create a simple React app that connects to MetaMask and displays the balance of your ERC-20 token.
   - [x] Features: Token balance display, transaction history.
   - [-] ENS: Create functionality to get avatars for accounts.

3. **Airdrop Smart Contract**

   - [x] Write a smart contract to distribute ERC-20 tokens to multiple addresses.
   - [x] Features:
   - [x] Automated airdrop function.
   - [x] Include edge-case testing (e.g., empty lists, gas-efficient bulk transfers).
   - [x] Add an optional frontend for interaction.

4. **The Graph Integration**
   - [ ] Read The Graph documentation.
   - [ ] Query subgraphs from existing dApps (e.g., Uniswap) for practical understanding.
   - [ ] Create functionality to query all contract and transaction data.

   - [ ] Features:
   - [ ] Tier-based or time-based dynamic token pricing.
   - [ ] Withdrawal limits and funding goals.
   - [ ] Integrate contract functions with React for real-time feedback.

7. **Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Lite**
   - [ ] Implement a simple exchange for trading ETH and your ERC-20 token.
   - [ ] Features:
   - [ ] Order matching.
   - [ ] Liquidity pool.
   - [ ] Analytics for pool performance and trading visualization.

   - [ ] Features:
   - [ ] Store token metadata efficiently (e.g., IPFS for URIs).
   - [ ] Optimize gas usage for ERC-1155 batch minting.
   - [ ] NFT marketplace with auction functionality.

10. **DeFi Yield Aggregator**

    - [ ] Build a dApp for depositing tokens and earning yield from multiple DeFi protocols.
    - [ ] Features:

- [ ] Strategy management.
- [ ] Dynamic APY display.

11. **Governance DAO**
    - [ ] Create a governance system for your ERC-20 token using OpenZeppelinâ€™s Governance module.
    - [ ] Features:

- [ ] Voting, proposals, and execution.
- [ ] Time-locking and quorum rules.
- [ ] Test proposal flow with multiple wallets.
